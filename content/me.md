<div class="about-me-page">
  <p>Hello! I'm Wassim, a Cloud DevOps Engineer with a passion for leveraging cloud technology to drive innovation and efficiency. Over the years, I’ve gained expertise in AWS and Azure, leading large-scale projects, and applying DevOps best practices to optimize cloud infrastructure. Currently, I’m managing a high-impact machine learning project for a multinational company, ensuring smooth operations and seamless deployments.</p>
  
  <p>I’ve had the privilege of working across diverse industries and within international teams, honing my technical and communication skills along the way. With certifications from both AWS and Azure, my focus has always been on delivering scalable, efficient solutions while staying ahead of the latest trends in cloud computing.</p>

  <h3>Beyond the Code</h3>
  <p>When I’m not diving into cloud architectures or writing scripts, you’ll often find me indulging in my other passions:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Anime:</strong> I’m a huge anime fan and love exploring both classic and new series. Whether it’s a deep storyline or just stunning animation, anime has been a long-time source of inspiration and relaxation for me.</li>
    <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Keeping up with the latest trends in finance is a hobby of mine. From markets to investment strategies, I enjoy learning how finance shapes the world and influences global dynamics.</li>
    <li><strong>Formula 1:</strong> As an avid Formula 1 fan, I follow the races, the teams, and the technical innovations that make the sport so exciting. The blend of technology and competition fascinates me, and I’m always rooting for my favorite teams!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>In short, I’m not just about cloud solutions – I’m passionate about learning, technology, and the world around me. Whether I’m at work or unwinding, I try to keep my curiosity alive and stay connected to the things that excite me.</p>
