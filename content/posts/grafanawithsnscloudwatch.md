To configure **Grafana Alerts** with **Amazon SNS**, follow the steps below.

### 1. Create an SNS Topic
- Go to the [AWS SNS Dashboard](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home).
- Click **Create topic**.
- Choose the **Standard** topic type and enter a name for the topic.
- After the topic is created, click **Create subscription**.
- Select a protocol (e.g., **Email** or **SMS**) and provide the corresponding endpoint (email address or phone number).
- Confirm the subscription through the email/SMS sent by AWS.

### 2. Set Up AWS Credentials in Grafana
- In the [AWS IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), create an IAM user with a custom policy that grants **sns:Publish** permissions to your SNS topic.
```sh
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "sns:Publish",
            "Resource": "<SNS-TOPIC-ARN>"
        }
    ]
}
```
- After creating the user, download the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key**.

In Grafana:
- Go to **Configuration** â†’ **Data Sources**.
- Add a **CloudWatch** data source.

- Enter the **Access Key ID**, **Secret Access Key**, and **AWS Region**.

- At the bottom of the page, click on Save & test, you should see a displayed message saying **1. Successfully queried the CloudWatch metrics API. 2. Successfully queried the CloudWatch logs API.**

### 3. Configure Grafana Contact point
- Go to **contact points** under **Alerting** then click on *Add contact point*.
- Enter a name for your contact point.
- Choose **AWS SNS** in Integration menu.
- In The Amazon SNS API URL, enter this : https://sns.{SNS-TOPIC-REGION}.amazonaws.com
- In the SNS Topic ARN, enter the ARN of the SNS topic that you created in step **1**.
- Click **Save contact point**
- You can test the integration by clicking on **Test** on the top right of the screen
- You should receive an email/SMS on the email/number subscribed to the SNS topic.

### 4. Configure Your alert
- Go to **Alert rules** under **Alerting** then click on *New alert rule*.
- Give your alert rule a name.
- under **Define query and alert condition** select the Data source entered in step **2**.
- You can select CloudWatch Metrics or CloudWatch Logs.

- Select what metrics or log group you want to query on.
- In section **B** select a reduce option to get a single number out of your query **A**
- In section **C** you can select your threshold, this will be the trigger for your alert.
- *Comment* : if you want to use logs, you will need to adapt your query to filter in a data series format.
- **Example**
```sh
fields @message, application
| fields strcontains(@message, 'error') as is_error, application
| stats sum(is_error) as error_count, application by bin(2m) as time_of_error, application
| sort time_of_error desc
```
- This is a query that will look up for any log that contains the word *error* and turn the result into data series.
![Query](/query.png)
- Scroll down, Create a new folder and select it.
- You will need to create an evaluation group in order to define how often the alert rule is evaluated, you can choose values from 10s to 1h.
- Pending period is how long the threshold configured in section **C** needs to be met to trigger the alert rule.
- Last mandatory entry will be the contact point that will be used to send the notifications, you can find the contact point created in Step **3** in the menu.
- Click **Save rule and exit** on top right
- You will start receiving notifications (email/SMS) whenever your alert rule conditions are met.
