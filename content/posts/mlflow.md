# MLflow

**MLflow** is an open-source platform designed to manage the complete machine learning lifecycle. It helps data scientists and machine learning engineers track experiments, package code, share and deploy models, and manage different stages of the machine learning workflow. MLflow provides several key components:

## Key Components

1. **MLflow Tracking**: 
   - Allows users to log and query experiments, parameters, metrics, and artifacts (such as models or datasets).
   - Crucial for reproducibility as it helps track different versions of models.

2. **MLflow Projects**:
   - Provides a standard format for packaging data science code in a reusable and reproducible way.
   - Projects can be run locally, on a remote machine, or in the cloud.

3. **MLflow Models**:
   - A tool to package machine learning models in diverse formats (such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).
   - Models can be deployed in multiple environments like REST APIs or batch inference systems.

4. **MLflow Model Registry**:
   - Helps manage model versions, allowing users to stage, approve, or archive models.
   - Provides versioning and governance features around the models.

## Benefits of MLflow

- Simplifies the machine learning workflow.
- Enhances collaboration between teams.
- Scalable across various environments.

## Why AWS ECS ?
**Scalability and Flexibility**
- ECS provides horizontal scalability, allowing you to scale up or down MLflow services (like the tracking server) based on demand.
- This is particularly useful when running a large number of machine learning experiments or deploying multiple models, ensuring that MLflow services are always responsive.

**Cost Efficiency**
- With ECS (especially when using Fargate), you pay only for the compute resources you use. This eliminates the need to maintain always-on servers, making it cost-effective for sporadic MLflow usage, especially in development and experimentation phases.

**High Availability and Fault Tolerance**
- ECS supports deployment in multiple AWS regions and across multiple availability zones, ensuring that your MLflow services are highly available.
- With load balancers and auto-scaling capabilities, ECS helps in managing failover and ensures uninterrupted access to your MLflow server.
